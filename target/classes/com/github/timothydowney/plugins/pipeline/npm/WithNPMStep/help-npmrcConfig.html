  Select an npmrc from File Config Provider.

  The <code>npmrc</code> contains configuration values for npm.  npm performs
  a lookup order starting in the current directory, then user, then global.  By
  choosing a specific provider, individual builds will be able to override settings
  and have them managed centrally as a config file provider.
